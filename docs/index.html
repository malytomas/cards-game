<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>All players choose their favorite race and reveal them simultaneously. Use the Race cards.
<p><ul>
<li><p>Players have chosen different races: deal all cards of the corresponding races to the players.
<li><p>Players have chosen same race: take all cards of that race, shuffle them, and deal half to each player. In case of odd number of cards, the last one is removed from the game.
</ul>
<p>Repeat the above process one additional time.
<p>Shuffle all remaining cards. Each player draws cards until they have at least 50 and at most 70 cards. This is their deck.
<p>Each player shuffles their deck and draws 10 cards. This is their hand.
<p>Each player may discard any cards and draw again same amount.
<p>Finally, each player receives 3 universal resource tokens (can be used as any of <img src="media/gold.png" alt="gold"> / <img src="media/mana.png" alt="mana"> / <img src="media/fire.png" alt="fire">).


<h2>Rounds &amp; turns</h2>
<p>The game is played in 6 rounds.
<p>Each round, all players play one turn, one after another, always in the same order.
<p>Each turn, the player plays the phases as described below, in this order.

<h3>Beginning of turn phase</h3>
<p>Apply <i>turn beginning</i> effects on cards.

<h3>Transformations phase</h3>
<p>Cards that allow transformations may transform now.
<p>You need to have the cards to transform into in your hand.
<p>The previous card goes back to your hand, and can be used for other transformations.
<p>If the transformed card has any effects, they are applied immediately, except transformations and production.
<p>Transformations do not cost any resources, even if there is some cost printed on the card.
<p>Transformed creatures keep their items and tokens. Meaning of the tokens may be changed in this way.

<h3>Production</h3>
<p>Put extra cards face-down on creatures or buildings as the resource tokens they have produced.
<p>The kind of a token is always known by the card it is placed on.
<p>Tokens are always face-down cards taken from the remaining cards that were not assigned to either player, or cards removed from the game.
<p>You may choose from which cards to take tokens when spending them. It is possible to spend tokens from multiple cards at once.
<p>Remove the cards representing the spent tokens from the game.

<h3>Combat phase</h3>
<p>Decide if you want to attack your opponent and state your decision.
<p>If you have decided to attack, proceed to the combat rules, then proceed to <i>Cards phase</i>.
<p>If you have decided not to attack, proceed to the next phase normally.

<h3>Creatures phase</h3>
<p>Place one creature or building into the play on your side of the table.
<p>If the creature/building has effects, they are immediately applied, except transformation and production.
<p>You can have at most one artifact. Artifacts cannot be targeted, transformed, killed, stolen, or removed.

<h3>Items phase</h3>
<p>Give items to own creatures.
<p>You may give up to 2 items in one turn.
<p>Effects on the items, if any, are immediately applied, except production.
<p>Each creature may have at most one item. Buildings cannot have any items.
<p>Creatures of some races cannot have items, but you may give items to other creatures even if you have chosen such race.

<h3>Spells phase</h3>
<p>Play non-combat spells.
<p>You may play up to 2 spells in one turn.
<p>Used spell cards are removed from the game.

<h3>Cards phase</h3>
<p>Discard up to 5 cards and draw same amount plus two.

<h3>End of turn phase</h3>
<p>Apply <i>turn end</i> effects on cards.


<h2>Final game evaluation</h2>
<p>Dead creatures may be resurrected for 1 <img src="media/mana.png" alt="mana"> each and buildings for 1 <img src="media/gold.png" alt="gold"> each.
<p>All <i>game end</i> rules are applied.
<p>All <i>non-final</i> additive, multiplicative, and conversion effects are applied, in this order.
<p>Attributes from all cards are summed for each player.
<p>All <i>final</i> effects are applied: additive, multiplicative, and conversions, in this order.
<p>Players with all cards in play (creatures, buildings, and items) of the same race gain bonus +10 to <img src="media/culture.png" alt="Culture">.
<p>Players with negative <img src="media/faith.png" alt="Faith"> multiply it by -1.
<p>Winner is decided (use first applicable rule):
<p><ul>
<li><p>If one player has more than 30 lead in one attribute (<img src="media/military.png" alt="M"> / <img src="media/culture.png" alt="C"> / <img src="media/faith.png" alt="F">), that player wins, unless the other player has over 30 lead in another attribute.
<li><p>Player who leads (by any amount) in more attributes (<img src="media/military.png" alt="M"> / <img src="media/culture.png" alt="C"> / <img src="media/faith.png" alt="F">) wins.
<li><p>Player with the highest sum of attributes (<img src="media/military.png" alt="M"> + <img src="media/culture.png" alt="C"> + <img src="media/faith.png" alt="F">) wins.
<li><p>Player with more resource tokens (<img src="media/gold.png" alt="G"> + <img src="media/mana.png" alt="M"> + <img src="media/fire.png" alt="F">) wins.
<li><p>Its a draw.
</ul>


<h2>Combat rules</h2>
<p>Winner of the combat kills (disables) one of opponent's creatures or buildings.
<p>TODO: defending with faith


<h2>Dead creatures</h2>
<p>TODO


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>When discarding and drawing again, you first discard all the cards, and only after that you draw new cards.
<p>Discarded cards go to the bottom of player's deck.
