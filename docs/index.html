<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Players choose their favorite race and reveal them simultaneously. Use the Race cards.
<p><ul>
<li><p>Players have chosen different races: deal all cards of the corresponding races to the players.
<li><p>Players have chosen same race: take all cards of that race, shuffle them, and deal half to each player. In case of odd number of cards, the last one is discarded.
</ul>
<p>The Race cards are discarded.
<p>Repeat the above process one additional time.
<p>Afterwards, shuffle all remaining cards and deal to players until they have 50.
<p>Players who have more than 50 cards will discard them randomly.
<p>Each player may discard up to 10 cards and draw again same amount.
<p>Finally, each player receives 3 universal resource tokens (can be used as any of <img src="media/gold.png" alt="gold"> / <img src="media/mana.png" alt="mana"> / <img src="media/fire.png" alt="fire">).


<h2>Turns</h2>
<p>The game is played in 5 turns.
<p>First player goes through all phases described below, in this order. After that goes the second player.

<h3>Production phase</h3>
<p>Put extra cards face-down on creatures or buildings as the tokens they have produced.
<p>The kind of a token is always know by the card it is placed on.
<p>Tokens are always face-down cards taken from the deck that is not assigned to either player when preparing the game.
<p>You may choose from which cards to take the tokens when spending them. It is possible to spend tokens from multiple cards at once.

<h3>Combat phase</h3>

<p>Attacking will prevent you from finishing remaining phases in this turn (you will be unable to place new creature into the game).
<p>Winner of the combat kills (disables) one of opponent's creatures or buildings.
<p>State your intention if you have decided to attack, and proceed by the combat rules.

<h3>Creatures phase</h3>
<p>Place one creature or building into the play on your side of the table.
<p>If the creature has effects, they are immediately applied, except for production.

<h3>Items phase</h3>
<p>Give items to own creatures.
<p>You may give up to 2 items in one turn.
<p>Effects on the items, if any, are immediately applied, except for production.
<p>Each creature may have at most one item. Buildings cannot have any items.

<h3>Spells phase</h3>
<p>Play non-combat spells.
<p>You may play up to 2 spells in one turn.
<p>Used spell cards are removed from the game.

<p>All <i>at the end</i> rules are applied.
<p>Each creature and building decides if it is considered as attacking, defending, or out of combat.
<p>All <i>non-final</i> additive, multiplicative, and conversion effects are applied, in this order.
<p>Attributes from all cards are summed for each player.

<p>Winner is decided (use first applicable rule):
<p><ul>
<li><p>If one player has more than a 50 lead in one attribute (<img src="media/military.png" alt="M"> / <img src="media/culture.png" alt="C"> / <img src="media/faith.png" alt="F">) that player wins, unless the other player has over a 50 lead in another attribute.
<li><p>The player who leads (by any amount) in more attributes (<img src="media/military.png" alt="M"> / <img src="media/culture.png" alt="C"> / <img src="media/faith.png" alt="F">) wins.
<li><p>The player with the highest sum (<img src="media/military.png" alt="M"> + <img src="media/culture.png" alt="C"> + <img src="media/faith.png" alt="F">) wins.
